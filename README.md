I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, user interface design, user experience design, traditional and digital illustration.

Furthermore, I work with interpreted programming languages both on the front-end with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript and on the back-end with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.

I'm also interested in learning Ruby, Go, Rust, and Crystal programming languages.
