I am a programmer with more than 8 years' experience writing applications for the web platform, with interests in accessibility, user experience, optimizing web systems, designing user interfaces, reducing development costs for software projects.

I specialize in the use of interpreted and dynamic programming languages, but I'm open to expanding this toolkit if necessary.

I'm currently working full-time on open source, but I'm open to interesting jobs that offer opportunities for learning and professional growth.

If you're interested in my profile, and you're not legally represented in my country, you can use a global human resources management platform such as [deel](https://www.deel.com/) or [remote](https://remote.com/) to hire my services.
