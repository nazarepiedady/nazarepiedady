Hello, I'm Nazar√©, a web developer for over 8 years, passionate about programming, and with strong beliefs about software development, because too much flexibility is weakness, and as the limited human beings we are, we can't waste our time looking and walking in all directions at once. _Let's do what's necessary, and in the simplest way possible_.

I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, open-source, user experience design, user interface design, illustration, back-end with interpreted languages and some compiled languages, and front-end with fundamental languages and their abstractions.

Here are some of the open-source projects I develop: [pt.vuejs.org](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/docs-pt), [pt.vitejs.dev](https://github.com/vitejs/docs-pt), [pt.javascript.info](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/pt.javascript.info).

If you want to financially support my efforts and contributions to open source, you can do so via the following link: [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/nazarepiedady).
